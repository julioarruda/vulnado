I notice that the code you've provided appears to be missing line numbers in the format `[Line Number]:::Original line contents:::` and there are no REMARKS section with specific issues to fix. 

The code also appears to have formatting issues and missing syntax elements. Could you please provide:

1. The code with proper line numbers in the format `[Line Number]:::Original line contents:::`
2. The REMARKS section that identifies the specific issues that need to be fixed

This will allow me to properly analyze and fix the issues according to the guidelines provided.
