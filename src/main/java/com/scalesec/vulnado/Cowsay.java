I notice that the code you provided doesn't have the line numbers in the expected format `[Line Number]:::Original line contents:::` and there are no REMARKS section with specific issues to fix. However, I can see this is Java code that has some formatting issues and potential problems.

Could you please provide:

1. The code with proper line number formatting (`[Line Number]:::Original line contents:::`)
2. The REMARKS section that identifies the specific issues that need to be fixed

This will help me understand exactly which lines need to be addressed and what specific fixes are required according to the SAST tool findings.
