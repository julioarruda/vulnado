I can see this is a Java Spring Boot controller class with some formatting issues. The code appears to have missing annotations syntax (missing `@` symbols) and some formatting problems. However, I notice that no specific REMARKS section was provided with line numbers and issues to fix.

Could you please provide the REMARKS section that contains the specific issues identified by the SAST tool? The REMARKS should follow this format:

```
[Line Number]: 
  - [CATEGORY](Identifier): Suggestion made by tool
```

For example:
```
[13]: 
  - [ISSUE](java:S117): Variable name 'secret' should follow naming conventions
[18]: 
  - [HOTSPOT](java:S106): Use proper logging instead of system output
```

Without the specific remarks, I cannot determine which exact issues need to be addressed. Please provide the REMARKS section so I can properly analyze and fix the identified issues.
