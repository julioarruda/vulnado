# User.java

## Overview

This Java code defines a `User` class which represents a user in a system. It provides functionality for user authentication and authorization using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). Additionally, it includes a method to fetch user details from a PostgreSQL database.

## Data Structures

| Structure | Description |
|---|---|
| `User` | Represents a user with an ID, username, and hashed password. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `token(String secret)` | Generates a JWT for the user. |
| `assertAuth(String secret, String token)` | Verifies the authenticity of a given JWT. |
| `fetch(String un)` | Retrieves a user from the database based on their username. |

## Insights

- The code uses the `io.jsonwebtoken` library for JWT generation and verification.
- It interacts with a PostgreSQL database using JDBC for user data retrieval.
- The `assertAuth` method throws an `Unauthorized` exception if the token is invalid, suggesting the existence of a custom exception class for handling unauthorized access attempts.
- The code directly embeds the username in the JWT subject, which might be suitable for this application but is generally not recommended for sensitive data. Consider using a dedicated claim for user roles or permissions instead.
- The database query in the `fetch` method is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. It's crucial to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent such vulnerabilities.
